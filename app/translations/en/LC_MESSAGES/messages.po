"A Better Translator is a language translation service based on the idea "
"that use of the Japanese language as an intermediate language yields a "
"better result. The reason behind this is that a large quantity of sample "
"data has been accumulated on the Google Translate database as everyone in"
" the world tries to translate Japanese porn into their language, and thus"
" Google Translate performs better with Japanese."
